    <p> This is the Paragraph section on the main page. Here I will describe myself a little. <br>
      Besides having a collection of really cool suits I also am an advid admirer of cars. I drive a 1984 mazda Rx7 GSL-SE which I love dearly. <br>
      I also am an accomplished martail artist and have practiced karate for the last fifteen years. I have captained my demo team through numerous national tournaments. <br>
      Finally I am also an accomplished student who has managed to complete enough public schooling to be admitted into the University of Rhode Island. <br>
      Here I will become a code god.
